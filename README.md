# Pixi.js Test Application

A super cool application to test Pixi.js. It includes three awesome demos:

1. A stack of 144 sprites, like a deck of cards. They move from one deck, to a brand new deck, on the other side of the screen.
2. A simple tool that combines random text, and an image, in various permutations and font sizes. It randomly cycles every two seconds.
3. Some really awesome looking fire. :fire:

You can view the live version on [gh-pages](https://laurheth.github.io/pixijs-test-2023/).

If you want to try it out locally, just clone the repository and run:

```
npm run serve
```
and when you are happy with any changes you've made, you can build it with

```
npm run build
```
